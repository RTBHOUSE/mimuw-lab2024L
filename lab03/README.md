# NoSQL databases

During this exercise we will configure a simple NoSQL database cluster using
*[Aerospike](http://https://aerospike.com/)* Community Edition. The cluster
will consist of 2 nodes with an in-memory data storages. We will also run a single instance
of *[Spring Cloud Schema Registry](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-schema-registry)*
to provide message schema resolution. Both Aerospike server instances and Schema Registry
instances should be installed on the virtual machines provided by RTB House.

The laboratory will be focused around a REST application with sources located in the
`nosql/` directory. The application is a simple CRUD which
creates/reads/updates/deletes objects defined with the *[Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.9.1/)* schema.
The application communicates via JSON messages which are then converted to/from Avro format
and stored to/read from the Aerospike database. The application depends on the Schema
Registry instance and registers the current `Message` schema upon start. You will have to run
the application against your configured server and then do some additional tasks
defined below.

Preferably you should be able to run the CRUD application from **your** local computer. To make
it work you need the Java JDK installed and an IDE - IntelliJ Idea is preferred.
You can also use Maven build system, if you don't want to use IDE (not recommended).

Import the Maven project with existing sources to have the application ready for deployment.


## 1. Prerequisites

You need to select two machines to serve as Aerospike nodes and one machine to serve
as a Schema Registry instance. The exemplary setup could look like this:

| Address                | Purpose       |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| stXXXvm101.rtb-lab.pl  | *Aerospike node 1*     |
| stXXXvm102.rtb-lab.pl  | *Aerospike node 2*     |
| stXXXvm103.rtb-lab.pl  | *Schema Registry instance*  |

Where 'XXX' is your student account number.

## 2. Aerospike servers installation

1. Log into one of your machines, preferably the first available one:

```bash
ssh <username>@<username>vm101.rtb-lab.pl
```

2. Install Ansible and sshpass:

```bash
sudo apt -y install ansible sshpass
```

3. Clone the laboratory repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/mimuw-lab2024L.git
```

4. Edit the `mimuw-lab2024L/lab03/aerospike/hosts` file to specify your selected Aerospike servers

5. Run the Aerospike installation playbook:
```bash
cd mimuw-lab2024L/lab03/aerospike
ansible-playbook --extra-vars "ansible_user=<user> ansible_password=<password> ansible_ssh_extra_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'" -i hosts aerospike.yaml
```

In case of problems with the playbook, upgrade to the latest version of Ansible:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade ansible
```

6. Check that the cluster contains two nodes with `asadm` tool:

```bash
asadm
Seed:        [('127.0.0.1', 3000, None)]
Config_file: /root/.aerospike/astools.conf, /etc/aerospike/astools.conf
Aerospike Interactive Shell, version 2.4.0

Found 2 nodes

Admin>exit
```

The Aerospike servers should be now configured.

## 3. Running the Schema Registry

Now log to the machine which will host the Schema Registry (stXXXvm103.rtb-lab.pl).

Install the Java Runtime Environment:
```bash
sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jre-headless
```

Download the Schema Registry jar file:
```bash
wget https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-schema-registry-server/1.1.5/spring-cloud-schema-registry-server-1.1.5.jar
````

Run the Schema Registry as a foreground process:
```bash
java -jar spring-cloud-schema-registry-server-1.1.5.jar > registry.log &
```

To stop it just read the `registry.log` file and check the process PID (every line
contains it) and just kill the application:

```bash
kill <pid>
```

The schema registry listens on TCP port **8990** by default.

## 4. Running the CRUD Application

### 4.1 About the application

The application in `lab03/nosql` directory is a simple CRUD application written in Java and (Spring Boot)[https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot] framework, which writes and reads data from your Aerospike cluster.

The application implements a very simple REST API with the following operations available:

 - GET `/endpoint/{id}` - returns `Message` stored in Aerospike with given `id`
 - PUT `/endpoint/{id}` - writes `Message` sent in a HTTP request body and returns the written content back
 - GET `/endpoint/increment/{id}` - increments the `count` field value in Message for the Message with given `id`

A `Message` is defined using Apache Avro schema at the following location in repository:
`lab03/nosql/src/main/resources/schema/Message.avsc`

**Remember to rebuild and rerun the application after every change in the `Message` schema.**

A `Message` class source file is generated in the following location: `lab03/nosql/src/main/generated/java/com/rtbhouse/nosqllab/Message.java`

The supported operations are defined in the `lab03/nosql/src/main/java/com/rtbhouse/nosqllab/resource/NosqlResource.java` source file.

All database related operations are implemented in the `lab03/nosql/src/main/java/com/rtbhouse/nosqllab/dao/MessageDao.java` source file.


### 4.2 Running the application

Clone the repository to **your** computer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/mimuw-lab2024L.git
```

As mentioned before, you will have to build the application. You can either do it in the IntelliJ IDE (import project with existing sources) or use Maven for this purpose:

```bash
cd mimuw-lab2024L/lab03/nosql
mvn clean install
```

**Notice**: if you use IDE, please rebuild the application using Maven in order to generate Java classes from Avro schema definition in `lab03/nosql/src/main/resources/schema/Message.avsc`.

Edit the configration file `lab03/nosql/src/main/resources/application.properties`
replacing the placeholders with appropriate data:

```properties
aerospike.seeds=<first node address>,<second node address>
aerospike.port=3000
spring.cloud.schemaRegistryClient.endpoint=http://<schema registry address>:8990
```

Now run the application
 - In IDE run the `com.rtbhouse.nosqllab.NosqlLabApplication` class.
 - Using Maven:
 ```bash
 mvn spring-boot:run
 ```

Test if the application works by writing a first record to the database:
```bash
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-type: application/avro-json' http://localhost:8080/endpoint/ -d '{"id":1, "field1": "test", "counter": 0}'
```
Read the written record:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/endpoint/1
```

Now write 10 records:
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl -X PUT -H 'Content-type: application/avro-json' http://localhost:8080/endpoint/ -d '{"id":'$i', "field1": "test'$i'", "counter": 0}'; done
```

And read them:
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl http://localhost:8080/endpoint/$i ; done
```

Your application should be running correctly.

## 5. Tasks

### 5.1 Observe the read and write throughput using `asloglatency` command.

Generate some traffic (for example 1000 requests) on the application and run the
`asloglatency` command on one of the Aerospike servers:

While running read requests:
```bash
sudo asloglatency -h {mimuw}-read
```

While running write requests:
```bash
sudo asloglatency -h {mimuw}-write
```

Observe the operations throughput.

### 5.2 Change the name of the `field1` in the `Message` schema and check if the application can read the records written with the previous schema.

Edit the `Message.avsc` file, change the name of the `field1` to `field2` and provide
field alias:
```
{"namespace": "com.rtbhouse.nosqllab",
  "type": "record", "name": "Message",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "id", "type": "long"},
    {"name": "field2", "type": ["null", "string"], "default": null, "aliases": ["field1"]},
    {"name": "counter", "type": ["null", "long"], "default": null}
  ]
}
```
**Be sure to rebuild and re-run the application afterwards!**

Reading any previously written record should return its contents but with the new `field2` name.

You can add some more changes to the schema, like an additional field, etc.
What kind of change would break the schema compatibility?

### 5.3 Disable one Aerospike server node and check if the operations still end successfully.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop aerospike
```

And then check if write and read operations still work.

Resume the Aerospike node afterwards:
```bash
sudo systemctl start aerospike
```

### 5.4 Provide endpoint for the `MessageDao.count()` operation mapped to the HTTP GET method.

The method is already implemented using UDF (User Defined Function) written in lua (`lab03/nosql/src/main/resources/udf/count.lua`), and registered in the `MessageDao` class. Just provide a proper endpoint, which invokes the method in the `NosqlResource` class.

### 5.5 Fix the implementation for the increment operation

The increment operation which increments the `counter` field value by 1 has a subtle bug.

1. Spawn two independent terminals, and run simultaneously a thousand increments on record with id=1:
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 1000); do echo $i; curl http://localhost:8080/endpoint/increment/1; done
```

2. Check the counter value for the record with id=1
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/endpoint/1
```

Why the counter value is not equal to "2000"?

3. Fix the `MessageDao.increment()` implementation.

4. Clear the counter value for the record with id=1 and retry the test from step 1:
```bash
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-type: application/avro-json' http://localhost:8080/endpoint/ -d '{"id":1, "field2": "test", "counter": 0}'
```

Hint 1: Use the [optimistic concurrency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control) technique.<br/>
Hint 2: Use the `GenerationPolicy.EXPECT_GEN_EQUAL` generation policy in `writePolicy`, set the `writePolicy.generation` to `record.generation`<br/>
Hint 3: React accordingly to the `AerospikeException` with the `resultCode` property equal to: `ResultCode.GENERATION_ERROR`<br/>
Hint 4: Read how alternatively the atomic counters could be implemented in [Aerospike](https://medium.com/aerospike-developer-blog/atomic-counters-using-aerospike-1f9c9730c903).

### 5.6 Reimplement the count method to use the database scan.

Look at the simple Scan Operations *[example](https://reintech.io/blog/aerospike-scan-operations-best-practices-data-retrieval)*.

Hint 1: define a `private static class` to implement the `ScanCallback` and to retain the count value.
Hint 2: use `LongAdder` or `AtomicLong` class to hold the count value.

### 5.7 Set the TTL of the record to 30 seconds in the `put` method.

Adjust the `WritePolicy`'s `expiration` property in the `MessageDao` class and observe if the written record disappears from the database after specified time.

### 5.8 Implement the delete method.

Implement the `delete` method in `MessageDao` class and map it to the HTTP `DELETE`
method in `NosqlResource` class.

### 5.9 Enable schema caching

By default the application must read the writer schema from the Schema Registry
every time when the record with non-matching schema is read. It is recommended
to cache the schemas within the application for performance reasons.

Hint: Set the appropriate option in the `SchemaRegistryConfig` class.


### 5.10 Enable the disk backed storage in Aerospike cluster

Your laboratory cluster is configured to use in memory data storage by default. Change the storage configuration for data to become persistent.

Hint: edit the proper `aerospike.conf` file section.
